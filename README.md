# EMNIST Trainer

## Description

EMNIST Trainer is a Python script designed to train and optimize a neural network on the EMNIST Balanced dataset. Leveraging TensorFlow and Keras Tuner, it automates dependency installation and hyperparameter tuning to create high-performing models for handwritten character recognition.

## Features

- **Automatic Dependency Installation:** Checks and installs required Python packages before execution.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizes Keras Tuner to identify optimal model configurations.
- **CPU-Optimized Training:** Configured to run efficiently on CPU-only environments, avoiding CUDA-related issues.
- **Data Augmentation:** Enhances model robustness through real-time image augmentation.
- **Visualization:** Optional plots for training metrics and confusion matrices.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
  ```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emnist-trainer.git
  ```
2. **Navigate to the ```EMNIST``` directory on your system**
3. **Run textScanner.py**
  ```bash
